# Tanya's ENA Desktop continued!
This is a continuation of the abandoned ENA desktop made by Tanya (developer of the JoelGC website and more)

This is being continued by members of the community independently, Tanya has stated "I don’t plan to make future updates to the current source code since I want to work on one from scratch, specifically so that it works with all operating systems"

They have also stated "I point out many errors, that’s why I prefer to do everything from scratch. I don’t mind if they want to fix those errors on their own"

# Why?
Because it's fun

# Compilation
